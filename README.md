django-coredata-path
====================

For no reason whatsoever, I spent a lot of time in late 2012 quixotically building a bunch of generic Django models and tools for interfacing with the [Path iOS app’s](https://path.com) local CoreData backing store. I wanted to share the images from my Path timeline with more fanfare than the typical trenchant-nostalgia retweet logorrhea that I tend to spout whenever I wind up alone on like a Saturday night, at the fulcrum between the weighty gigabyteage of my memories, on one hand, and the endless attention vacuum of internet connectivity on the other.

But so whatever, I wrote a ton of code but I never launched it or got it up and running, at least not beyond a most rudementary  wireframe-y locally-deployed concept-proving unsexiness. And while I can’t speculate as to the cause for my abrupt pivot away from this project (probably whiskey) I did indeed go on to myriad adventures – during which I forgot all about it. 

“It” in this case referring to “this codebase” – which although incomplete as a web project is not without a few specific charming attributes. To wit:

* A Django model field for binary-format .plist files
    * … affording seamless data access and transparent read/write backend storage, and whatnot
* A corrollary Django binary-plist-aware serializer interface
    * you can safely do `loaddata`/`dumpdata` type stuff on models whose tables have binary plist columns
* Abstract base models that introspectively make their own boilerplate-y adapter classes
    * So you don’t have to:
    * Adapter classes automatically generated for Watson search
    * No-nonsense Django model-admin classes, autogenerated and registered
* A functional and coherent start towards a flexible and introspective CoreData schema mapping within the Django ORM
    * If I hadn’t drank all that whiskey I would have tied the introspection together with SqlSoup
